# Renders the agent-framework reference library from the global reservoir
# (~/.claude/skills/new-agent/references/) into this template's .agents/ tree.
#
# One-way: reservoir -> template, never the reverse. ~/.claude/skills/new-agent/
# references/ is canon (edit it there); run this script, then commit the result
# here, whenever the reservoir changes and the template should pick it up.
#
# Companion to sync-global-skills.sh, which syncs .claude/skills/ (Claude Code
# workflow commands). This one syncs .agents/ (tool-agnostic agent knowledge,
# readable by ADK tooling or any other harness). Two scripts because the two
# trees have different shapes and different render rules.
#
# WHY A RENDERER AND NOT `cp` (2026-07-19): template/.agents/skills/ was
# hand-copied once and covered by no script. The drift ran BACKWARDS — the
# template's framework-selection carried an entire third framework (Vercel AI
# SDK) that the reservoir lacked, and nobody noticed. It has since been promoted
# to canon. Two files still need a real transform (see RENDER RULES).
#
# --dry-run: print what would change (with per-file detail) without writing.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What goes where
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# TWO DESTINATIONS, because these are two different kinds of document:
#
#   SKILLS[]     -> .agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md
#     Framework and scaffold guides. Genuine skills: each already carries
#     authored frontmatter in the reservoir (name + description, plus Apache-2.0
#     attribution on the Google-derived ADK pair). An agent harness discovers
#     and loads these by description.
#
#   REFERENCES[] -> .agents/references/<name>.md
#     Code-generation payload — the cap-* capability specs plus core/eval/test/
#     infra/docs. These are emitted-code templates, not skills: they have no
#     frontmatter in the reservoir and no meaningful "use this when" trigger.
#     Rendering them as skills would mean inventing 23 descriptions and diluting
#     a directory whose README promises a curated framework reference library.
#     They ship so a scaffolded project can generate capability code offline,
#     with no access to ~/.claude.
#
# Deliberately NOT synced: nothing. This is a full mirror of the reservoir's
# references/ directory — 30 files, ~11k lines, shipped into every scaffolded
# project regardless of which capabilities it enables. Chosen (2026-07-19) for a
# simple script with no copier-answer coupling; the cost is dead weight in
# projects that use one capability. Revisit if template size becomes a problem.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RENDER RULES — why this is not `cp`
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 1. Link rewriting. The reservoir is a flat directory, so canon says
#    "read `adk-scaffold.md`". In the template those same docs are skill
#    directories, so the rendered copy must say
#    "`.agents/skills/adk-scaffold/SKILL.md`". Applies to SKILLS[] only —
#    REFERENCES[] stay flat in both trees, so their relative links already work.
#
# 2. Copier variables. langgraph-scaffold.md uses `source_root` as a generic
#    placeholder; a scaffolded project has the real copier variables
#    `py_project_root` and `ai_source_root` (copier.yaml:323,328). Verified as a
#    genuine substitution, not drift.
#
#    Canon writes it BOTH ways in adjacent lines — braced inside the example
#    path (`{source_root}/agents/...`) and bare in the prose that follows
#    ("if `source_root` isn't obvious"). Substituting only the braced form
#    leaves the sentence naming a variable its own example no longer uses, so
#    both forms are rewritten. Order matters: braced first, or the bare rule
#    corrupts the braced occurrence into `{py_project_root}/{ai_source_root}`
#    nested inside the outer braces.
#
# Frontmatter needs NO synthesis: all 7 SKILLS[] files already carry authored
# frontmatter in the reservoir, including the Apache-2.0 attribution block on
# the two Google-derived ADK skills. Do not generate it here — a hand-written
# description outperforms a guessed one, and the license block must survive
# verbatim.

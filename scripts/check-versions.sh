# Report dependency drift between versions.toml and each consumer manifest.
#
# Read-only by design. This repo is canon for shared versions, and the other
# repos pull from it — a script that edited galactus or dssg would be writing to
# repos it does not own, on branches it did not create. Drift is reported; the
# fix happens in the consumer, on its own branch, with its own test run.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-versions.sh            # report drift, exit 1 if any
#   scripts/check-versions.sh --quiet    # exit code only
#
# Exit codes: 0 = aligned (or only skips), 1 = drift found, 2 = bad invocation.

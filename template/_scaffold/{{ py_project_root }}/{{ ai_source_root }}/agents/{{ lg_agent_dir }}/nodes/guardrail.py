"""Guard layer 1 — screens the untrusted user turn before any model call.

This node delegates to `security.guards.check_input` rather than carrying its
own pattern list. It previously held a four-entry substring check that
duplicated, less well, what `security/guards.py` already did — and left the
real module called by nothing (AIT-50). One implementation, one place to extend.

The node still owns the graph-shaped decision: `check_input` returns a verdict,
and translating that verdict into `blocked` / `block_reason` state that
generate_node reads is this node's job, not the guard's.

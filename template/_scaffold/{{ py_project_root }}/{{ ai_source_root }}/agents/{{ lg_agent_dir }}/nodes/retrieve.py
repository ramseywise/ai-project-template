"""Retrieval node — also guard layer 2, the indirect-injection seam.

Retrieved documents are untrusted input that never passed through
`guardrail_node`: a poisoned corpus entry is not a user turn, so `check_input`
never sees it. `filter_content` runs here, at the point where retrieved text
first becomes prompt material, rather than in `generate_node` — filtering at
the source means any future consumer of `context_snippets` inherits it.

Snippets are filtered, not dropped: one injection line does not make the rest
of a document useless, and silently dropping passages looks like a retrieval
bug (see security/README.md).

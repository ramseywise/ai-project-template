"""Step 15 — the classification workflow that composes every prior step.

`run_classification` is the only entry point a run script calls. Everything below
it — column inference, sampling, splitting, calibration, threshold choice — is
already tested in isolation; what is untested until here is whether they compose
without a seam leaking.

The guard test is the reason this module exists rather than being inlined into a
run script: a transformer fitted outside the CV pipeline inflates every score in
the report, and it does so silently. `assert_no_transform_outside_pipeline` is
asserted rather than trusted, so it needs a case where it actually raises.

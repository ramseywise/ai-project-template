"""Probability calibration — making 0.7 mean "roughly 70% of these pay".

Calibration is usually filed under polish. Here it is a **correctness property**,
because of what consumes the output: `threshold.choose_threshold` computes an
expected cost by multiplying probabilities against a cost matrix. That arithmetic
is only meaningful if the probabilities are probabilities. A model that ranks
perfectly but outputs 0.9 for everything has a fine ROC-AUC and makes the cost
calculation return nonsense — it will recommend contacting everyone or no one.

Tree ensembles are the common offender: averaging over trees pushes predictions
toward the middle, and boosting with a log-loss objective often pushes them
toward the extremes. Neither is wrong as a *ranking*; both are wrong as
*probabilities*.

Which calibrator to use:

- **sigmoid** (Platt) fits two parameters. Correct when the distortion is
  monotone and roughly S-shaped, and it is the safe choice on small validation
  sets because two parameters cannot overfit much.
- **isotonic** fits an arbitrary monotone step function. Strictly more flexible,
  and strictly more able to overfit — the usual guidance is >1000 validation
  rows before preferring it.

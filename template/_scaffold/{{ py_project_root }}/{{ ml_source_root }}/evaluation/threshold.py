"""Cost-based threshold selection — arithmetic, not a hyperparameter.

0.5 is a convention inherited from balanced data and symmetric costs. Almost no
real deployment has either. If a false negative costs 10× what a false positive
costs, the threshold that minimises expected cost is nowhere near 0.5, and
tuning it "until precision looks right" is choosing an operating point by feel
while pretending it came from the model.

This module is the deterministic-code-owns-the-decision boundary: the model
produces the content (probabilities), and a pure function over a cost matrix
produces the decision. Nothing here fits, samples, or reads global state — the
same inputs return the same result forever, which is what makes the chosen
threshold auditable after the fact.

Expected cost at threshold t, over n rows:

    cost(t) = cost_fp * FP(t) + cost_fn * FN(t)

Only the *ratio* of the two costs matters for the argmin; the absolute values
matter for reporting a number to a stakeholder, so both are kept.

    the **lower** threshold, which flags more rows — under an asymmetric cost
    matrix where `cost_fn > cost_fp`, that is the conservative side.

"""Continuous-target prediction.

Structurally the same as classification minus the probability machinery: no
calibration (there is nothing to calibrate), no threshold (there is no decision
boundary), no sampling (there are no classes to balance). What remains is the
part that matters — every transform inside the Pipeline, out-of-fold predictions
from `cross_val_predict`, and R² reported next to RMSE rather than instead of it.

R² alone is misleading in the direction people rarely check: it is scale-free, so
a model with an R² of 0.85 can still be off by an amount that makes the
prediction useless for the decision it feeds. RMSE is in the target's units,
which is the number to hand a stakeholder.

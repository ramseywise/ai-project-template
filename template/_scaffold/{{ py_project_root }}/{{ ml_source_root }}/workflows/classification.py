"""Binary and multiclass classification, end to end.

One call takes a frame and a target name and returns a scored comparison across
every available model. The steps in between — infer column types, choose a
leakage-safe splitter, build a transformer, wrap everything in a Pipeline,
cross-validate, calibrate, pick a threshold — are the steps a person does by
hand every time and gets subtly wrong roughly one time in five.

The ordering is the load-bearing part:

1. Column types are inferred from the **training frame only** conceptually, but
   in practice from the whole frame's *dtypes and cardinality* — which is
   metadata, not signal. Nothing here is fitted outside the fold.
2. The splitter is chosen before anything is fitted, so no transform can precede
   the split.
3. Every transform lives inside the Pipeline, so `cross_val_predict` refits it
   per fold.

Out-of-fold predictions come from `cross_val_predict`, not from a single
train/test split. Every row gets a prediction from a model that never saw it,
which gives metrics computed over the whole frame instead of over one arbitrary
30% slice.

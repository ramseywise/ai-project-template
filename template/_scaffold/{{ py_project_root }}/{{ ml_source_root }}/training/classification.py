"""Step 15 — the classification workflow.

One call that runs the whole chain: infer column types, build a leakage-safe
pipeline per fold, cross-validate every candidate model on identical folds,
calibrate out-of-fold probabilities, and choose a cost-minimising threshold.

Two design choices are load-bearing and worth stating rather than leaving to be
inferred from the code:

**Everything that learns from data goes inside the per-fold pipeline.** The
preprocessor is fitted on the fold's training rows only, never on the frame.
This is the difference between a score that transfers and one that is inflated
by an amount nobody measured, and because the inflated version looks *better*
there is no natural moment at which anyone notices. `RunResult` therefore
carries the claim explicitly so a run script can assert it.

**Predictions are out-of-fold.** Each row is scored by a model that did not
train on it, so calibration and threshold selection see honest probabilities.
Choosing an operating point on in-sample scores picks a threshold for a model
that no longer exists once it is refitted.

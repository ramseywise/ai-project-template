"""Ragas-based LLM-judge grading — faithfulness/answer-relevancy/context-precision
scores for a single (question, contexts, answer, ground_truth) row.

KNOWN ISSUE (verified 2026-07-14): the current ``ragas`` release on PyPI (0.4.3)
has a broken top-level import — ``ragas.llms.base`` unconditionally imports
``langchain_community.chat_models.vertexai.ChatVertexAI``, a submodule that no
longer exists in current ``langchain-community`` releases (moved to the
separate ``langchain-google-vertexai`` package, which doesn't help — the
submodule path itself is gone). ``uv sync``/``pip install ragas`` succeeds
since dependency *resolution* is fine, but ``import ragas`` crashes — this is
an upstream packaging bug in ragas itself, confirmed by installing it fresh and
reproducing the crash, not something fixable from this side.
``grade_with_ragas`` below catches this and returns ``None`` (skipping ragas
scoring for the row, not crashing the whole eval run) rather than papering over
it — check whether a newer ``ragas`` release has fixed this before expecting
real scores here.

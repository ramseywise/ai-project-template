/**
 * Fail when a module under src/ is imported by nothing.
 *
 * Why this exists (AIT-44): four agent-support modules once shipped into every
 * TypeScript render referenced by neither the agent nor a test. Two of them
 * carried real type errors that reddened CI for two days while `npm test`
 * stayed green throughout — nothing imported the files, so only `tsc` ever saw
 * them. A module no code path touches gets its first real exercise from a type
 * checker, which is the wrong place to find out.
 *
 * Why not eslint-plugin-import's `import/no-unused-modules`: that rule cannot
 * run under ESLint 9 flat config without a legacy `.eslintrc` shim, and even
 * with the shim it silently reports nothing — a planted orphan module passes
 * clean (import-js/eslint-plugin-import#3079). A guard that always passes is
 * worse than no guard, so the import graph is built directly here.
 *
 * The check is module-level ("does any other file import this?"), not
 * export-level. Unused individual exports are a separate, noisier question; a
 * starter template legitimately ships helper functions the user has not called
 * yet. A file nobody imports at all is never legitimate.

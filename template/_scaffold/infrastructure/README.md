# infrastructure/ — deploy skeleton

Ships with every full scaffold regardless of `deployment_target`, so the
deploy story is versioned from day one instead of bolted on later.

- `containers/` — Dockerfiles + compose for the long-running services
  (see `containers/README.md`).
- `terraform/` — IaC skeleton, including the data-classification resource
  tag derived from `data_sensitivity` (see `terraform/README.md`).

CI/CD: `.github/workflows/` at the project root holds the test workflow, plus
`cd.yml` (build-and-push to GHCR) when the project was scaffolded with a
docker/cloud deployment target and a containerized agent to build.

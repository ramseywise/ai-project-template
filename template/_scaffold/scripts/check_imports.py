"""Fail when a module under the project's source roots is imported by nothing.

Why this exists (AIT-51): this is the Python half of the guard AIT-44 shipped for
the TypeScript render (`scripts/check-unimported.mjs`). Both renders have the same
failure mode — a module ships into every scaffold referenced by neither the agent
nor a test, and gets its first real exercise from a type checker rather than a code
path. `security/guards.py` was exactly that on the Python side (#50).

Why a bespoke walker rather than an off-the-shelf tool:

  - `vulture` is heuristic dead-code detection. It reports unused *names* with a
    confidence score, false-positives on Pydantic models, FastAPI route handlers
    and LangGraph node registrations, and needs a whitelist file that rots.
  - `ruff`'s F401 is per-file *unused imports* — the opposite question.
  - `deptry` works at dependency/package level, not module level.

The question here is narrow and structural: **does any other module import this
one?** An `ast.walk` over `Import`/`ImportFrom` answers it exactly, the way the TS
version walks specifiers.

The check is module-level ("does any other file import this?"), not export-level.
Unused individual exports are a separate, noisier question; a starter template
legitimately ships helper functions the user has not called yet. A file nobody
imports at all is never legitimate.

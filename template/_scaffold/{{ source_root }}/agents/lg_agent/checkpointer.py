    confined to this one factory function so nothing downstream needs to change.

    Cached (@lru_cache) since PostgresSaver's connection pool is meant to live for
    the process lifetime, not be recreated per call — same singleton shape as
    get_vector_index()/get_embeddings() elsewhere in this template. The
    from_conn_string() context manager is entered but deliberately never exited:
    the pool needs to outlive this function call, and process teardown reclaims it.
    PostgresSaver's async methods run the underlying sync psycopg calls via a
    thread-pool executor (not native async) — fine at this starter's scale; swap to
    AsyncPostgresSaver if checkpoint I/O becomes a throughput bottleneck.

Use when the user invokes /sanyi (init|review|audit), asks to create or enforce a SANYI.md change contract, classify components into 变易/简易/不易 layers, or check a diff/repo for cross-layer violations (invariants made configurable, prompts or tunables hardcoded, schema entropy growth)."

# SANYI (三易) — change contracts for agent architectures

## Core model (operational summary)

SANYI is a **change-contract** system: it sorts every component into one of
three change layers, records the assignment in `SANYI.md` at the repo root, and
reports **cross-layer violations** on each diff — the decay dimension single-PR
review cannot see. The three layers:

- **变易 Bianyi (the ever-changing)** — must be cheap to change: prompts,
  thresholds, routing rules, flags. Their values live only in the config/prompt
  layer; hardcoding one elsewhere is BN-1.
- **简易 Jianyi (the simple)** — must stay simple: state schemas, interfaces,
  tool schemas, and the execution graph. Unjustified, unbounded complexity is
  debt against a `budget` (JY-1/2/3).
- **不易 Buyi (the invariant)** — must never change without the highest review:
  safety, compliance, escalation fallbacks. Never bypassable via config / env /
  flag (BY-1/2/3). Admission test: violating it causes a security, legal,
  financial, or trust failure.

Layers may also **evolve on purpose**, recorded in `## Migrations`; only silent
moves are violations (MG-1).

> **First Law of agent SANYI:** LLMs are probabilistic, so a constraint
> implemented only in a prompt is soft. A Buyi invariant MUST have a
> deterministic code-layer implementation; a declared invariant that is
> prompt-only is violation **BY-4**.

The full rationale, I Ching grounding, and worked examples live in
`README.md` (human-facing) — this file is the operational spec the skill
executes.

## Mode dispatch

| Invocation            | Mode                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `/sanyi init`         | Create the contract (interview)                |
| `/sanyi review`       | Enforce the contract against the current diff  |
| `/sanyi review --fix` | Same, plus auto-fix BN-1 findings              |
| `/sanyi audit`        | Re-measure the whole repo against the contract |
| no argument           | Ask which mode                                 |

If `review` or `audit` is requested and the target repo has no `SANYI.md`,
offer to run `init` first.

Also consumed (via `review-shared` skill preload or on demand):

## Shared rules (all modes)

1. **Debt baseline**: report only NEW violations. Anything recorded in
   `## Debt` is known and is not re-reported.
2. **Dangling detection**: an entry whose `paths` match no existing file is
   reported as UN-2 — never silently skipped.
3. `## Pending` entries are enforced at the strictest level (as Buyi).

## Mode: init

Read `references/interview-guide.md` first — it carries the heuristics and the
question bank. Then:

1. **Auto-draft**: read the target repo's `CLAUDE.md`, directory structure,
   config/prompt/state files, and integration boundaries. Draft Bianyi and
   Jianyi entries directly from conventions and schemas (measure `current` on
   the spot); collect Buyi _candidates_ only.

   ⚠️ These are all **declaration** sources — what the repo says about itself.
   A draft built only from them describes intent, not the system. Step 2 is
   what makes it a contract.

2. **Verify every candidate against implementation — BEFORE writing anything.**
   A contract entry asserting a guarantee the code does not provide is worse
   than no entry: review mode reports only NEW violations, so a false
   guarantee baked in at init goes permanently silent. For each candidate:

   | Check | How | If it fails |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Call sites exist | grep the entry point across the repo; exclude the module's own definition, its `__init__` re-exports, docstrings, and comments | Entry is unimplemented — draft it with the gap named, seed `## Debt` (BY-4) |
   | Paths resolve | test each declared path exists on disk | Drop or correct the path (UN-2) |
   | Evidence asserts the contract | open each `evidence` test; confirm it exercises the declared entry point, not a local reimplementation | Narrow the `evidence` line to what it truly covers — never leave it overstated |
   | No bypass | grep for env vars / flags gating the entry point; check their **defaults** | Record BY-2; a default-off guard is not a guarantee |
   | No divergent reimplementations | grep for the entry point's core logic (regexes, redaction, validation) living inside consumer packages | Record BY-4 + note each divergence |

   **Vendored/template code is the high-risk case**: modules that arrived via a
   template or scaffold commit are frequently never wired. Check `git log
   --diff-filter=A` on suspiciously unused modules.

   Report contradictions rather than resolving them silently — if a grep
   contradicts something already read, the grep is suspect first. Re-run it
   before trusting an empty result.

3. **Confirm per component** — one question at a time, multiple-choice
   (accept / re-layer / park). Present each candidate **with its step-2
   verification result**, so the human confirms against reality, not intent.
   Disputes go to `## Pending`.
4. **Buyi interview** — the layer machines cannot infer. Use the question
   bank; run the first-law probe ("where is this enforced in deterministic
   code?") on every entry — step 2 has already answered it for most.
5. **Over-declaration pushback** — more than ~7 Buyi entries: challenge each;
   Buyi must stay scarce, like root access.
6. **Closing audit** — run the audit mode below; write findings into
   `## Debt`.
7. **Deliver** — `SANYI.md` at the repo root + a short debt summary.

**When a contract states a target the code does not yet meet** (the human
ratifies intent rather than narrowing to current behavior), say so in the file:
the entry describes the target, an inline comment names the gap, and `## Debt`
carries the violation. A contract may aspire — it may not imply the aspiration
is already true.

## Mode: review [--fix]

Input: the current diff — staged changes if any; else uncommitted
working-tree changes if any; else current branch vs the default branch (if
the branch has diverged too far for a meaningful unit, say so and ask which
range to review) — plus `SANYI.md`.

1. Glob-match changed files to contract entries; note unmatched files (UN-1)
   and dangling entries (UN-2).
2. Enforce per layer:

| Check                                                         | Code | Severity | Default action                                                                         | With `--fix`                                   |

Disambiguation rules:

- **Review is diff-scoped.** Pre-existing violations not caused by this diff
  (e.g. an invariant that was already prompt-only) are NOT Findings — surface
  them under "Debt candidates" with a recommendation to run an audit. JY-2 is
  subsumed by JY-1 when the same growth breaches the budget — report only
  JY-1.
- **BY-1 is subsumed** when BY-2 or BY-3 fires on the same entry — report only
  the more specific code.
- **Files referenced in an entry's `evidence` count as contract-matched** for
  UN-1 purposes (changes to them are BY-3 territory, not "unassigned").

3. **Bookkeeping (always, not gated on `--fix`)**: update Jianyi `current`
   stamps for touched entries.
   For MG-1, offer to add a `## Migrations` record (date, from → to,
   rationale) rather than treating the move as an error.
4. **`--fix`**: apply the BN-1 relocation procedure from
   `references/violations.md` §4. Never touch BY-\*, JY-\*, MG-\*, UN-\*
   findings.
5. Emit the report using the `references/violations.md` template, ending with
   the one-line verdict: _does this diff change the system's change-contract
   structure?_
6. Offer to record accepted findings into `## Debt` so they stop
   re-reporting.

## Mode: audit

Input: the whole repo (not a diff) plus `SANYI.md`. Invoked standalone or as
init step 5. Priority order:

1. **BY-4 sweep** — for every Buyi entry, find its deterministic code-layer
   implementation; prompt-only invariants are the #1 target.
2. **BN-1 inventory** — all Bianyi values hardcoded outside their declared
   layer.
3. **Jianyi entropy** — measure every budgeted component (shape, graph, and
   escape hatches: flag untyped `dict`/`Any` catch-alls as JY-3), refresh
   `current` stamps and `last-audit`.
4. **Migration drift** — components whose natural layer has shifted from their
   contract assignment with no `## Migrations` record (MG-1); propose the
   record.
5. **Hygiene** — UN-2 dangling entries; major components with no entry (UN-1).

Output: report (audit variant of the `references/violations.md` template);
offer to write/update `## Debt`.

# infrastructure/terraform

A minimal AWS deployment skeleton for the `lg_agent` chat-agent service
(Terraform resource labels keep the internal `lg_agent` name): ECS Fargate
task behind an Application Load Balancer, an ECR repo to push images to, and a
Secrets Manager secret for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

**This is a starting skeleton, not battle-tested production infrastructure.**
Read this file and the comments in `main.tf` before pointing it at anything real.
Specifically, this stack does NOT include:

- HTTPS or a custom domain (the ALB listens on plain HTTP :80 only — adding TLS
  means an ACM certificate + Route 53 record + an HTTPS listener + probably a
  redirect from :80, none of which is here)
- Any autoscaling policy — `desired_count` is a fixed number, not a target driven
  by CPU/request metrics
- A dedicated VPC — it reuses the account's default VPC/subnets, and ECS tasks get
  public IPs directly (`assign_public_ip = true`) rather than sitting in private
  subnets behind a NAT gateway
- Secret rotation, WAF, blue/green deploys, multi-service/multi-module structure,
  or persistent storage for the DuckDB index (see the `vectordb_path` variable —
  on Fargate that path is ephemeral container disk; a real deployment would need
  an EFS volume or would bake a pre-built index into the image)

Treat this as a first draft to extend, the same way you'd treat a scaffolded app —
not something to `terraform apply` against a production AWS account unmodified.

## Layout

```
main.tf                  # provider, networking (default VPC), ECR, IAM, SGs, ALB, ECS
variables.tf              # project_name, aws_region, sizing, image, secret ARN, ...
outputs.tf                 # ALB DNS name / service URL, ECR repo URL, secret ARN
environments/dev.tfvars    # small sizing, desired_count = 1
environments/prod.tfvars   # larger sizing, desired_count = 2 (still no autoscaling)
```

## Prerequisites

- Terraform >= 1.5, AWS provider `~> 5.0` (pinned in `main.tf`)
- AWS credentials configured (env vars, `~/.aws/credentials`, or SSO) with
  permissions to create VPC lookups, ECR, ECS, IAM, ALB, Secrets Manager, and
  CloudWatch Logs resources
- Set up remote state before using this for anything beyond a one-off experiment
  — this skeleton has no `backend` block, so it defaults to local state

## Deploying

```sh
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform init

# Review the plan against the dev sizing/vars:
terraform plan -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars -var="project_name=YOUR_PROJECT"

terraform apply -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars -var="project_name=YOUR_PROJECT"
```

Then, before the service can actually serve traffic:

1. **Push an image.** `terraform apply` above creates the ECR repo but the ECS
   task definition falls back to `<repo_url>:latest`, which doesn't exist yet.
   Build and push:
   ```sh
   aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-central-1 | \
     docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account_id>.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com
   docker build -f infrastructure/containers/lg_agent/Dockerfile -t <repo_url>:latest .
   docker push <repo_url>:latest
   ```
   Then re-run `terraform apply` (or force a new deployment:
   `aws ecs update-service --force-new-deployment ...`) to pick it up. To pin a
   specific tag instead of `latest`, pass `-var="container_image=<repo_url>:<tag>"`.

2. **Populate the secret.** `terraform apply` creates an empty Secrets Manager
   secret (see the `anthropic_api_key_secret_arn` output). The task definition's
   `secrets` block in `main.tf` sets `valueFrom = <arn>` (no JSON key suffix),
   which means ECS expects the *entire* secret value to be the raw API key
   string — not a `{"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "..."}` JSON blob. Set it as a plain
   string:
   ```sh
   aws secretsmanager put-secret-value \
     --secret-id "$(terraform output -raw anthropic_api_key_secret_arn)" \
     --secret-string 'sk-ant-...'
   ```
   If you'd rather store it as JSON (e.g. to bundle multiple keys in one
   secret), change `valueFrom` in `main.tf` to `"<arn>:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY::"`
   instead. **Double-check the exact `valueFrom` suffix syntax against current
   AWS ECS docs before relying on it** — this is one of the pieces flagged as
   worth verifying yourself (see below).
   Alternatively, if you already manage this secret elsewhere, skip secret
   creation entirely by passing `-var="anthropic_api_key_secret_arn=<existing arn>"`.

3. Get the URL: `terraform output service_url`.

## Tearing down

```sh
terraform destroy -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars -var="project_name=YOUR_PROJECT"
```

## Things flagged for you to double-check

`terraform validate` (v1.10.3) passes against this configuration, and
`terraform fmt` reports no diffs — both were run locally. That confirms the HCL
is syntactically valid and internally consistent (resource references resolve,
types match, etc.), but validate does NOT check against live AWS API behavior.
Before relying on this, verify:

- The ECS `secrets` block's `valueFrom` format for a plain-string vs. JSON
  Secrets Manager secret (noted in step 2 above) — get this wrong and the
  container will fail to start with a secret-resolution error.
- Fargate `cpu`/`memory` pairings (256/512 is a valid combination as of this
  writing, but AWS's allowed pairings do change).
- Whether your account's default VPC actually has subnets in enough AZs for the
  ALB (ALBs require >= 2 AZs) — some older/cleaned-up accounts don't have a
  usable default VPC at all, in which case `data "aws_vpc" "default"` will fail
  and you'll need to point this at a real VPC.

# Integration tests

This tier makes real calls to external services — most notably the Anthropic API via
`agents.lg_agent.clients.llm.generate` — rather than mocking them. These tests are
opt-in only: they cost money, require a real `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env`, and are
excluded from `make test` (`pyproject.toml`'s `addopts` ignores `tests/integration`
by default). Mark every test in this tier with `@pytest.mark.integration` (the marker
is registered in `pyproject.toml`) and run them explicitly with `make test-integration`
(`pytest tests/integration -q -m integration`). There are no tests here yet because a
freshly generated template has no API key configured in CI; add them once the project
has budget and credentials for real end-to-end LLM calls, e.g. asserting
`generate_node`'s non-blocked path produces a non-empty, on-topic answer against the
live model.
